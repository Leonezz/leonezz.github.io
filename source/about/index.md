# Intro

I am currently a postgraduate major in computer science, my research interests include Natural Language Processing, Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning and Information Extraction.

I am a person of passion in both programming and life (at least as what I think : ) ), my passion involves modern C++, embedded systems, typescript, React, deep learning, [reading books](https://zhuwenq.notion.site/Book-List-69ab897ee3184ccea99eb33eac976f3e), [watching movies](https://zhuwenq.notion.site/Movie-List-f2d5b594d437400091712ac108963427), [photography](https://blog.zhuwenq.cc/categories/Photograph/) and making coffee.

I will write here something about programming, reading and learning. Please leave a comment or contact me directly if you have something to share, I appreciate it a lot!

I hope you can enjoy my articles here.

Best regards!
